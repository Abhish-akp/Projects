## Introduction

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a tool that provides a graphical representation of different sorting algorithms. By visualizing the sorting process, users can better understand the efficiency and mechanics of each algorithm.

## Features

- Visualization of various sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable speed to control the animation.
- Ability to generate random arrays.
- Step-by-step and continuous playback modes.
- User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   https://github.com/Abhish-akp/Sorting-Visualizer.git
